# You can use the utility text_dataset_from_directory() to generate a labeled tf_dataset object from a set of text files on disk filed into class-specific folders.
# 
# Let’s use it to generate the training, validation, and test datasets. The validation and training datasets are generated from two subsets of the train directory, with 20% of samples going to the validation dataset and 80% going to the training dataset.
# 
# Having a validation dataset in addition to the test dataset is useful for tuning hyperparameters, such as the model architecture, for which the test dataset should not be used.
# 
# Before putting the model out into the real world however, it should be retrained using all available training data (without creating a validation dataset), so its performance is maximized.
# 
# When using the validation_split and subset arguments, make sure to either specify a random seed, or to pass shuffle=FALSE, so that the validation & training splits you get have no overlap.

# Prepare the data
# In particular, we remove <br /> tags.
# Having looked at our data above, we see that the raw text contains HTML break
# tags of the form '<br />'. These tags will not be removed by the default
# standardizer (which doesn't strip HTML). Because of this, we will need to
# create a custom standardization function.

# Now that we have our custom standardization, we can instantiate our text
# vectorization layer. We are using this layer to normalize, split, and map
# strings to integers, so we set our 'output_mode' to 'int'.
# Note that we're using the default split function,
# and the custom standardization defined above.
# We also set an explicit maximum sequence length, since the CNNs later in our
# model won't support ragged sequences.
vectorize_layer <- layer_text_vectorization(
  standardize = custom_standardization_fn,
  max_tokens = max_features,
  output_mode = "int",

# Now that the vectorize_layer has been created, call `adapt` on a text-only
# dataset to create the vocabulary. You don't have to batch, but for very large
# datasets this means you're not keeping spare copies of the dataset in memory.

# Let's make a text-only dataset (no labels):
text_ds <- raw_train_ds |>
  dataset_map(\(x, y) x)

# Let's call `adapt`:
vectorize_layer |> adapt(text_ds)

# There are 2 ways we can use our text vectorization layer:
#   
#   Option 1: Make it part of the model, so as to obtain a model that processes raw strings, like this:
#   
text_input <- keras_input(shape = c(1L), dtype = "string", name = 'text')
x <- text_input |>
  vectorize_layer() |>
  layer_embedding(max_features + 1, embedding_dim)

# Option 2: Apply it to the text dataset to obtain a dataset of word indices, then feed it into a model that expects integer sequences as inputs.
# 
# An important difference between the two is that option 2 enables you to do asynchronous CPU processing and buffering of your data when training on GPU. So if you’re training the model on GPU, you probably want to go with this option to get the best performance. This is what we will do below.
# 
# If we were to export our model to production, we’d ship a model that accepts raw strings as input, like in the code snippet for option 1 above. This can be done after training. We do this in the last section.

# Make an end-to-end model

# A string input

# Turn strings into vocab indices
indices <- vectorize_layer(inputs)
# Turn vocab indices into predictions
outputs <- model(indices)

# Our end to end model
